"Nathaniel Deutsch debunked a book claiming that this historical political territory was annually traversed in a triangular migration by a “tri-racial” group partly composed of Fulani pastoralists, the Ben-Ishmael tribe. This territory was seen as a testing ground for “ward republics” by a man who wanted to divide it into areas like Assenisipia and Metropotamia. Zane’s Trace cut through this territory, where the “French 500” arrived to settle Gallipolis after William Duer sold them worthless deeds. A  university named for this territory created the title Dean of Women for the “do everything” activist Frances Willard. This territory was established by the successor to an act that created a survey system based on 6-mile-wide grids called townships.

"A journal entry about people on this body of water ignoring the writer’s boat gave rise to the New Age legend of “invisible ships.” Repatriation efforts have targeted weapons stolen from this body of water, like four-pronged spears and a red mangrove shield. Though she actually lived to its north, the “king plate” gorget given to Cora Gooseberry calls her the “queen” of this body of water. An expedition to this body began the “tyranny of distance” and included Mary Bryant, who was later defended in court by  James Boswell. A cape on this body of water is named for Daniel Solander, who visited it as one of the Linnaeus apostles. After the Gweagal  people’s land along this body proved “unsuitable,” Arthur Phillip settled nearby at Port Jackson with the First Fleet. For 10 points, Joseph Banks called for penal settlement of what body of water where the HMS Endeavour collected plants?",Botany Bay ,History,10
"This leader developed a precursor of non-alignment called “negative equilibrium.” A plot against this leader was encouraged by Ann Lambton, backed by the Rashidian brothers’ gangs, and signaled by the phrase “It is now exactly midnight.” An action spearheaded by this leader aimed in part to relieve workers in a shanty town called “Paper City.” This notoriously weepy leader lay in bed wearing pink pajamas during negotiations with Averell Harriman that helped make him  Time’s Man of the Year for 1951. This leader of the National Front came to power after General Razmara was assassinated for opposing his campaign against the “Seven Sisters” cartel.

"A treatise opposing a king of this name provides a rare scriptural justification for trial by ordeal to uphold one in which a knight fetched a stone from a vat of boiling water. Hincmar of Rheims attacked a king with this name for nonsensically claiming that his wife got pregnant via sodomy with her brother. The Susanna Crystal may depict the attempt of a king of this name to annul his marriage to Theutberga and marry his concubine Waldrada. After being declared co-emperor by the  Ordinatio imperii, a man with this name led forces against his father at the Field of Lies in a rebellion sparked by the latter’s remarriage to Judith of Bavaria. A man of this name founded a kingdom that was partitioned in the Treaty of Meerssen  and later became the Duchy of Lorraine.

"Jean Marteilhe  wrote a rare memoir of life as one of these people, who were watched by argousins  and worked in groups called chiourmes  in the scaloccio  system. Working as a chaplain to these people inspired Vincent de Paul to found the Lazarists. A statue of the Virgin Mary was supposedly thrown out a window by John Knox during the 19 months he spent as one of these people after being found in St. Andrew’s Castle with the killers of David Beaton. Instead of working in this role, forçats  were sent to the Toulon  Bagne  after a 1748 edict that ended the use of this role as the most common punishment for male convicts in France. In the Mediterranean, captives served in this role while chained to benches on the xebecs  used by Barbary pirates.

"Description acceptable. This regime sent truckloads of red-shirted thugs to throw rocks at an opposition party’s HQ in the 27 July incident. The exposure of this regime’s purchase of a fleet of dilapidated East German warships led this regime to ban magazines like Editor and Tempo. A crony of this regime, the “plywood king” Bob Hasan, led its negotiations with the fraudulent Canadian gold mining firm Bre-X. The fall of this regime ended a “dual function” system that gave the  ABRI an inside track to civil service positions. During the riots that brought down this regime, its “business pillar,” the Salim Group conglomerate, was used to justify the burning of thousands of ethnic Chinese businesses. This regime was opposed by Megawati’s PDI and followed by B. J. Habibie’s Reformasi after falling during the Asian financial crisis.

This ruler fortified and alternately names the citadel of Halabiye, the site of many of the “tower tombs,” rock-cut hypogea, and frontal-facing funerary reliefs characteristic of this ruler’s realm. This ruler’s  cavalry of “oven-pot men,” or clibanarii, were worn out by extreme heat at the Battle of Immae. Zabdas led an invasion of Egypt under this ruler, who claimed Ptolemaic descent.

"In this colony, girls were hired for a short-lived plan to spin spider-silk from golden orb-weavers. Though it was later used in the Maghreb, insurgents in this colony were the first targets of the “oil spot” strategy of an administrator who placed its ethnic groups under a system of indirect rule called the “politics of race,” Joseph Gallieni. Rival ethnic groups in this colony formed the Party for the Disinherited and the MDRM. Frantz Fanon critiqued a book written after the bloody suppression of a 1947 uprising in this colony,  Prospero and Caliban by Octave Mannoni. The 1895 “red shawl” rebellion started among a côtier ethnic group in this colony, the Sakalava. This colony was formed after highland members of the Hova caste fought occupiers in a war that ended with their last queen’s exile to Réunion.

"This man failed to apply his treatise on The Management of Troops to his only military post, which ended with his troops ransacking his house and forcing Shams al-Dawla to exile him. This man’s magnum opus superseded a “Royal Book” that Constantine the African introduced to Europe. This man’s mentor Masihi died in a sandstorm while they fled to the Ziyarid emir Qabus in Gorgan in an effort to escape Mahmud of Ghazni, who sent portraits of this man to cities like Reyy, Tus, and Balkh. This author’s work was used in bimaristans and is celebrated by his  tower mausoleum in Hamadan.

"Men set to engage in this action were found to have stood on a chair at the Red Lyon Inn to receive coins from “Mr. Punch” in a 1774 scandal for Thomas Rumbold and Francis Sykes. People who did this action based on their ability to boil cauldrons on their hearths were known as “potwallopers.” Cartoonists portrayed the Duchess of Devonshire kissing men before they performed this action in an apocryphal instance of the crime of “treating.” This action, which could be  controlled by installing its performers in so-called “burgage tenements,” was done by “forty-shilling freeholders” in gatherings called “hustings.” A tiny number of people performed this action at sites like Gatton, Dunwich, and Old Sarum.

"In the leadup to this event, a former friend of its subject was uninvited via a phone call from Evelyn Lincoln due to fears that his marriage to Swedish actress May Britt would upset southerners. A speech at this event promised that “we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe” for the cause of liberty. A myth claims that this event caused American men to stop wearing hats. Leonard Bernstein composed a fanfare for this event that premiered during a  gala produced by its subject’s Rat Pack associate Frank Sinatra. This event established a precedent by inviting a cultural figure who, because of bright sunshine, had to recite the line “The land was ours before we were the land’s” instead of “Dedication.” For 10 points, an exhortation to “ask what you can do for your country” was given at what event where Robert Frost read “The Gift Outright”?","inauguration of John Fitzgerald Kennedy  ",History,10

"This historical region, which lay south of the Jireček  Line, was visited by merchants whose safety is promised on the Vetren inscription. In art, women from this region are identified by their geometric sleeve tattoos. This region’s inhabitants destroyed the Celtic kingdom of Tylis and a series of colonies built at a site called the Nine Ways. In this region, the Bessians used a weapon that is described emerging from the Son of Man’s mouth in the Book of Revelation, the single-bladed rhomphaia. A god from this region often simply called “the  hero” is portrayed in Roman funerary art as its namesake “horseman.” This region’s Odrysian Kingdom conquered a colony that Athens used to extract timber from this region, Amphipolis.

This historian identified a transition from “patriarchy” to “paternalism” in a region he characterized as “in, but not of,”  capitalism, contrary to the theories of Robert Fogel. This historian explored “resistance within accommodation,” exemplified by shirking and religious practice, in a book that uncovers the “Nat Turner” inside of “Sambo.” For 10 points, name this historian who chronicled the “world the slaves made” in a book titled for a spiritual, Roll, Jordan, Roll.",Eugene Genovese  ,History,10
"A legend holds that this leader, like Antoine Parmentier and Frederick the Great, put guards around a shipment of potatoes to stir public interest in the crop. This head of state allied with the Napist “Governmentals” of the Russian Party against the Constitutionalists of the English Party, leading Hydriot shipowners to burn the flagship of his navy. This colleague of Karl Nesselrode helped create Swiss federalism and the Holy Alliance as Alexander I’s foreign minister. In  revenge for this leader’s imprisonment of the bey of the Mani peninsula, the Mavromichalis clan assassinated him outside a church in his capital of Nafplion. This former minister of the Septinsular Republic turned down leadership of the Filiki Eteria. This man’s First Hellenic Republic was succeeded by the monarchy of Otto I.

Words meaning “wall” and “room,” agadir and ghorfa, name the multi-storied examples of these structures attached to ksar citadels in North Africa. The ancient Chinese concept of cháng píng, or “ever-normal,” structures of this type, was adopted by Henry Wallace and supplemented by yearly loans under the New Policies of Wáng Ānshí. Next to  Mohenjo Daro’s bath complex stands a building that Mortimer Wheeler dubiously identified as a “great” one of these structures. A passage in Genesis in which these structures are built after a dream of seven lean cows prompted medieval writers to misidentify the Pyramids as these structures. For 10 points, name these often elevated and ventilated storehouses for threshed cereal crops.",granaries ,History,10
"The Chronicle of Seert credits this event for inspiring the Rogationtide Fast of Nineveh, which persisted in phases named for Kavad II Sheroe and Emmaus. Peter Sarris traced emphyteutic church rents to this event during a flurry of laws, like the anti-sodomy edict of Novel 141, that were issued after John of Ephesus compared it to God’s winepress. Gregory of Tours blamed this event for Pelagius II’s replacement by Pope Gregory I. The “dust-veil event” preceded this event, which delayed Abraha’s repairs of the Ma’rib Dam. Evagrius Scholasticus  dated this event to two years after the Sack of Antioch began the Lazic War. This event of the Late Antique Little Ice Age was traced to the Tiānshān’s enzootics in 2013, when paleogenetics matched its causative agent to the account of Procopius.

"In this state, Aaron Henry led the “Loyalists” against the “Regulars” of governor Bill Waller. In 2002, Antonin Scalia’s opinion in Branch v. Smith upheld a redistricting plan in this state that aided the son of his hunting buddy Charles Pickering. This is the home state of Democratic direct mail strategist Hal Malchow, who had himself euthanized in March 2024. After winning exactly half its districts in 1999, this state’s most recent Democrat governor, Ronnie Musgrove, was chosen by its legislature in a since-abolished procedure. A  hard-of-hearing senator from this state would have been the sole reviewer of the Nixon tapes in the “Stennis compromise.” A Sovereignty Commission handled desegregation in this state, where the Freedom Democratic Party was founded by Fannie Lou Hamer.

"The so-called “rescues” conducted by these people are romanticized in Jean-Baptiste Debret’s lithographs. Victor Brecheret sculpted a granite monument to these people that protesters graffitied with the word “murderers” in 2013. The “patriarch” of these people fathered the first mixed-race “Mamluks.” These people spread a simplified version of an indigenous language called the língua geral. The regionalists of the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution claimed the heritage of these people, who used a word for feathery-legged birds to denigrate the boots of the  newcomers they faced in the War of the Emboabas. In the 1640s, the Mboboré defeated these people’s last raid on the Jesuit reductions. Columns of these people pushed west of the Tordesillas line behind the flag-carriers that gave these people their name. For 10 points, name these prospectors and slave-traders who colonized Brazil.","bandeirantes  ",History,10
"These people accompanied Maternus’s expedition to a mysterious region called Agisymba. These people’s main exports were “carbuncles” or “Nasamonian stones” thought to have been carnelian and amazonite. In the 1st century CE, these people’s misadventures in the lands to their north include their secret backing of Tacfarinas’s revolt and their intervention in Oea’s war with a neighboring city. These people extracted “fossil water” from hamada plateaus with shaft-aerated channels that resemble Persian qanats and are now known as  foggara. According to Herodotus, these people tended backwards-grazing cattle and used four-horse chariots to hunt Troglodytes. After defeating these agriculturalists based in wadis of the Fezzan region, Lucius Balbus’s expedition proceeded south as far as the Niger River. For 10 points, name this ancient civilization of southern Libya.",Garamantes ,History,10
"Solstice sunrises at this place’s outlying Wijiji building were photographed by G. B. Cornucopia. In a term coined by Cynthia Irwin-Williams, this place’s “phenomenon” denotes a cultural flourishing of the 11th century CE. “Horseshoes” thought to be shrines or smoke signal sites line the perfectly straight roads that emanate from this place, like the “Great North” one. Theorists of this site’s “meridian,” like Stephen Lekson, hold that Aztec Ruins and Paquimé were built to  align with it on a north–south axis. Near this site, Anna Sofaer documented a spiral petroglyph called the Sun Dagger that may track an 18.6-year lunar cycle. T-shaped doors and imported timber roof beams characterize this site’s “Great Houses,” such as Pueblo Bonito, which influenced Mesa Verde to its north. For 10 points, Fajada Butte looms over what Ancestral Pueblo archaeological site, a canyon in New Mexico?",Chaco Canyon  ,History,10
"The spread of this crop has been dated linguistically by David Schoenbrun using words for “bill-hook,” and can be carbon-dated by its “volcaniform” phytoliths. As a slave trader, John Newton ran a barracoon on an island group named for this crop, where the mixed-race Cleveland and Caulker dynasties fought bloody wars. This staple crop of the Chaga, Haya, and Mangbetu kingdoms superficially resembles the Ethiopian enset. Women tended gardens of this crop while men worked on public works like road-building under the  kabakas of Buganda. Since it is less labor-intensive than yams, the introduction of cattle-raising and this crop to the African Great Lakes in the 1st century CE allowed a population explosion. An English word for this crop comes from Wolof. For 10 points, a variety of what crop is named for being brought to the Kew Gardens by William Cavendish?",bananas ,History,10
"William Davison was locked up as a patsy for this event, which ends a book by Jenny Wormald presented as a “study in failure.” It’s not a military campaign, but this event is vividly recounted in the first chapter of Garrett Mattingly’s most popular book. Amias Paulet refused to carry out a less official alternative to this event. Before this event, its subject disrobed to reveal symbolically crimson undergarments. An oath called the Bond of Association was used to justify this event after evidence was obtained from  coded letters smuggled in beer barrels. This event took a gory turn when a man grabbed its subject’s red wig after a series of botched swings. This event took place at Fotheringhay Castle after its subject was tried for involvement in the Babington Plot.

"An activist with this last name released the tape “To My People,” which exhorts “It is our duty to fight for our freedom / It is our duty to win.” Kersplebedeb  published essays by a PG-RNA member with this last name in the collection Stand Up, Struggle Forward, 20 years after he wrote of his time as an Eight Tray gang leader in Monster. After writing to Pope John Paul II, a person with this last name agreed to an NBC interview that was crosscut with an interview with the widow Rose Foerster. An all-white jury convicted a  revolutionary with this last name for crimes allegedly committed alongside Sundiata Acoli after they were stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike.

"After this party decided to form a “bloc within” rather than a “bloc without,” its opponents formed the Western Hills group after swearing an oath to expel it. A university librarian who co-founded this party was attacked in an article urging “More Study of Problems, Less Talk of ‘Isms.’” After his time in Indonesia, a Dutch man known by the pseudonym “Maring,” Henk Snievlit, helped found this party. A ruling party allied with this smaller party to form the  first United Front under the influence of the diplomat Adolf Joffe. This party “commands the gun” per a principle put forth after the failure of its Autumn Harvest uprising. This party was targeted in a 1927 purge led by the Green Gang, then targeted in “bandit suppression” and encirclement campaigns.

"After the last ruler of this state was dragged out of a French embassy and executed on Rhodes, its lands were the subject of a reconnaissance mission by the travel writer Elizabeth Craven. After setting a rival state’s capital ablaze, this state was defeated by artillery fire from “walking forts” at the Battle of Molodi. This state led “harvesting” expeditions to the dyke pole , or “wild field,” with its vassals, the Nogai mirzas. Kabardia was made a nominal vassal of this state, while this state itself was removed from the  Ottoman sphere of influence, by the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca . After annexing this state ruled by the Giray dynasty, Catherine the Great embarked on the “Taurida Voyage” to view its lands, apocryphally leading Grigory Potemkin to populate it with fake villages.

"The “silk letter” movement operated alongside a movement named for this title, whose followers declared a kingdom in Ernad during a rebellion that ended after prisoners were suffocated in the “Wagon tragedy.” In hopes of transferring this title, Marmaduke Pickthall went to Nice, France, to get a former holder’s consent for his daughter to marry the Nizam of Hyderabad’s son. A year before a 1924 law replaced this title, it was reimagined in a book by Rashīd Riḍā. Mappilas joined a movement named for, and aimed at  preserving, this title, which operated contemporaneously with the Non-Cooperation Movement in British India under the leadership of the Ali brothers. Sharif Hussein bin Ali briefly took this title, which was held by the Ottoman Sultan for 500 years from Selim I until its abolition by Atatürk.

"Description acceptable. These documents are the main source on the KoKo, a “commercial coordination” program. Both Katherine Verdery and Timothy Garton Ash wrote memoirs about reading these documents, which were reconstructed by “puzzle women.” People developed a type of “envy” called Aktenneid  over these documents and could be “gaucked” by them via the Gauck Authority, which was run by a pastor who estimated that they take up 111 kilometers of shelf space. These documents revealed the “operational decomposition” technique. The  “Rosenholz” subset of these documents are CD-ROMs about the HVA. The term “IM,” or “unofficial collaborator,” refers to the massive network of civilians who contributed to these documents and were often ostracized after these documents were opened for public access in the ’90s.

"Under these policies, petitioners could change their race by buying “thanks to take” certificates, fueling later fearmongering about a “pardocracy.” A Secret Report by two members of a “geodesic mission” drove these policies, which John Lynch analyzed as a bureaucratic “second conquest.” A tobacco monopoly imposed as part of these policies prompted Manuela Beltrán to tear up a sales tax edict in Socorro, kicking off the non-Iberian Comunero Revolt. These policies replaced a class of magistrates said to have had the motto “I obey but I do not comply,” the  corregidores, with the intendancy system. The visitador José de Gálvez helped design these reforms, which led to Túpac Amaru’s revolt and reduced the power of criollos to improve revenue extraction for Charles III. For 10 points, name these 18th-century reforms of Spanish America, which are named for the dynasty that planned them.",Bourbon Reforms  ,History,10
"Lorna McDaniel recorded the belief that people who ate salt couldn’t do this activity. A “password” is used to perform this activity in one variation on a motif recorded dozens of times in the oral history Drums and Shadows. A song named for this activity declares “Meet that hypocrite on the street / First thing he’ll do is show his teeth / Next thing he’ll do is tell a lie / And the best thing to do is pass him by.” Stories about people performing this activity may have been inspired by an 1803 mass suicide at Igbo Landing. Virginia Hamilton’s collection of  African American folktales is named for people who could do this activity. Folktales about this activity inspired Faith Ringgold’s Tar Beach and Toni Morrison’s Song of Solomon, which ends with Milkman Dead learning to do it.

"This ethnic group’s practice of placing vials of perfume at the head of graves was discovered by the 30-year-long Leon Levy Expedition in a city earlier excavated by Hester Stanhope. This group’s cylindrical loom weights and bird-decorated “bichrome ware” mark their settlement of a region that alternately names the Via Maris trade route. This group is widely identified with a group depicted wearing feather headdresses alongside the Tjeker and Denyen in the Medinet Habu reliefs. This group’s theorized  Aegean ancestry has been corroborated by digs at Ashkelon, which like Ekron and Ashdod  was a city in their Pentapolis.

After persecuting Buddhists as a Daoist theocracy under Tàiwǔ, a dynasty of this name sponsored the Yúngāng grottoes and the first Lóngmén caves. The Tuòbá clan of the  Xiānbēi established a “Northern” dynasty of this name.

This sultanate’s Keira dynasty created a system managed by “master of the ax” stewards and fuqara holy men. The slave trader al-Zubayr conquered this sultanate from his network of zariba forts in the Sea of Gazelles during the 1870s Turkiyya era. After succeeding the Tunjur kingdom, this sultanate created the hakura system to give land grants to  cattle-herding Baggara clans. More recently, the region named for this sultanate spawned the Justice and Equality Movement among the Zaghawa people, who have been displaced by self-identified Arab militias on horseback.

"The unlikely estimate that there were 50,000 of these people living in Paris in 1625 comes from a book by Marin Mersenne. A book by Lucien Febvre  argues that Bonaventure des Périers  and Étienne Dolet  were only called these people as a rhetorical gesture, since these people didn’t exist in the 16th century. David Hume claimed he did not believe in these people, only to be told he was sitting with fifteen of them, while at dinner with his host’s “Coterie.” The “testament” of one of these people, the  priest Jean Meslier , was expurgated by Voltaire, who attacked these people for celebrating John Needham’s creation of “eels” from flour and quipped against them in reply to the Treatise of the Three Imposters. The 18th century’s most famous one of these people wrote The System of Nature. For 10 points, the Baron d’Holbach was what sort of person once thought unable to swear oaths?","atheists  ",History,10
"The last saloon-keeping member of this group, Paddy Bauler, crowed that his peers “ain’t ready for reform yet!” in the same year that the socialist Leon Despres  joined it.

In 2003, this governmental body and the FAA were not informed before the overnight bulldozing of an airport. Members of this body control zoning via a “privilege” or “prerogative” that “goo-goos” have called to eliminate.  29 members of this body led by “Slow Eddie” Burke and “Fast Eddie” Vrdolyak blocked progressive appointments in a 1980s series of “wars” named for this body.

"This ruler hosted a “Great Debate” that consisted of five days of uninterrupted lectures by a visiting theologian, followed by an arson attempt by his disgruntled opponents. The following century, the capital established by this ruler was the focus of the “tripartite struggle.” After this ruler’s death, a Tibetan and Nepalese army led by Wang Xuance  invaded to depose a pretender that Chinese sources call Aluonashun . This ruler’s defeat by Pulakeshin II is attested on the Aihole  Inscription.
