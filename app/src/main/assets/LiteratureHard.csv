After passing “limestone scars with ragged pines,” a guide cries out “Strike leftward!” to direct the speaker to this place, whose “pointed roofs” prompt him to ponder whether it’s “a palace of the Kings of  France.” As he explores this place, the speaker imagines his past “robust teachers” whispering, “What dost thou in this living tomb?” A poet drew on the night he spent in this place with his bride Frances Wightman to label modernity and religion as “two worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born.” For 10 points, what Carthusian monastery inspired a melancholic set of “Stanzas” written by Matthew Arnold?",Grande Chartreuse ,Literature,10
"One of these figures symbolizes a form of tragedy that deals with a “seething cauldron of the dark world will and psyche.” The town of San Pere is home to a set of characters named after these figures, including a former track star who presents her severed ear to her lover, in The Brother/Sister Plays of Tarell Alvin McCraney. In a 1963 play, a tyrant becomes one of these figures after seemingly killing himself at an ayan tree, prompting his followers to chant, “the king did not hang!” One of these figures inspired the theory of the Fourth Stage.  Ulli Beier’s Mbari Club staged a play by Duro Ladipo about one of these figures, who are “not to blame” in a reworking of Oedipus Rex by Ola Rotimi. One of these beings who led their descent to earth appears in the play A Dance of the Forests. For 10 points, what beings include Wole Soyinka’s “muse” Ogun?","orishas ",Literature,10
"In a story from Ling Ma’s collection Bliss Montage, the narrator reads a story by this author that reframes a passage from Mark Salzman’s Iron & Silk. In that story by this author, an author claims that the “favorite story she’s written” is a story she read about a Chinese student whose “happiest moment” was his wife eating duck in Beijing. This author used Philip Yorke’s letters about his Russian journey to construct the story “Lord Royston’s Tour” and reworked a French author’s letters into stories like “The Cook’s Lesson.” This author incorporated excerpts from  Shinichi Suzuki’s autobiography in a story from her collection Break It Down. A story by this author consists solely of James Boswell’s statement that “Samuel Johnson is indignant that Scotland has so few trees.” For 10 points, name this American author of flash fiction and translator of Swann’s Way and Madame Bovary.",Lydia Davis ,Literature,10
"This sort of place titles a short story in which a laborer and a street-cleaner both get stomach poisoning after eating mushrooms by a tram stop. A short story collection subtitled for “seasons” in this sort of place is structured as five years of Marcovaldo’s life. In a book titled for these places, a man asks, “Why do you speak to me of the stones? It is only the arch that matters,” to which his companion replies, “Without stones there is no arch.” A book named for these places ends with the narrator outlining two ways to escape suffering in “the  inferno of the living.” The “hooded brothers” duplicate one of these places underground by posing corpses. These places are paired with “Memory,” “Desire,” and “Signs” in the chapter titles of a novel in which they have female names like Eusapia and Diomira.

"As a man in this novel hides in a flower garden, he becomes madly jealous after the protagonist tells her husband she’s in love with a man she refuses to name, not realizing she means him. In a sexually-coded scene in this novel, the protagonist and her lover flirt gleefully while forging a letter, resulting in a very bad fake that fails to convince the Queen and ends her affair with the protagonist’s uncle. Nancy Mitford’s introduction to her translation of this novel chronicles its author’s time with  court ladies like Henrietta of England. This anonymously-published novel was likely revised by Rochefoucauld , its author’s lover. At this novel’s end, its protagonist chooses not to marry the Duke de Nemours after meeting him at Henry II’s court.

"It’s not Amharic, but the term for double meanings in this language’s poetry is analogized to “putting feather on our words” in Brandy McDougall’s books. A poet of many “name songs” in this language wrote a poem addressed to a lawn sprinkler while under house arrest. Slam poet Jamaica Osorio titled her most famous piece after this language’s “creation chant,” whose 16 “eras” begin with the “slime which established the earth,” proceed through fish and birds, and end with a royal  genealogy. This language’s word for sugar cane and the Japanese word for song, bushi, name a folk genre collected by Harry Urata. The epic Kumulipo was translated from this language by a 19th-century monarch whose prolific output as a composer and poet in this language includes a song that repeats “Farewell to thee, farewell to thee.” For 10 points, name this language used by Lili‘uokalani.",Hawaiian language  ,Literature,10
"In a play set in one of these places, a man uses Paul Éluard and Tintin to explain a description given by someone from Shepherd’s Bush. A word for this sort of place titles a play in which a duchess is among several characters who have tufts of hair fall off while sleeping. Chiwetel Ejiofor debuted the role of Chris in a play set in one of these places that is titled for his description of a bowl of fruit, Joe Penhall’s Blue/Orange. A word for this sort of place titles a play in which Jesus, Queen Victoria, and  Patrice Lumumba all appear in Sarah’s apartment, by the Black Arts writer Adrienne Kennedy.

"While debating how long they have been engaging in this activity, a woman tells an aspiring clergyman, “Oh! Do not attack me with your watch.” A character’s love of this activity, which her rivals attribute to “conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum,” is analyzed in a nonfiction book in a chapter titled for that character’s petticoat. A writer’s disregard of the Napoleonic wars is contrasted with her acceptance of the “cult of landscape” in a book on the “history of” this activity by Rebecca  Solnit. Miss Hurst cattily says Elizabeth, “has nothing, in short, to recommend her but” her excellence at this activity, which Darcy says has “brightened” her “fine eyes” when she does it after Jane suddenly falls ill. For 10 points, Marianne is caught by a rainstorm while doing what activity favored by Jane Austen’s more free-spirited “genteel country ladies,” the subject of Solnit’s Wanderlust?","walking  ",Literature,10
"This man uses his “vigorous warmth” to scatter “his Maker’s image” in the opening lines of a satirical poem set before “priest-craft did begin” and “before polygamy was made a sin.” A poem attributed to this man was expanded into the first English sonnet sequence, a “meditation” by Anne Locke. In Renaissance Self-Fashioning, Stephen Greenblatt notes that a cycle by Thomas Wyatt may make a veiled comparison between this man and Henry VIII, since Wyatt could not safely say to Henry, “Thou art the man.” Pietro  Aretino’s paraphrase of a set of “penitential” poems attributed to this man influenced Tudor poets. In the King James Version, this man tells Nathan that a thief who steals a ewe lamb “shall surely die,” not realizing he is judging himself. For 10 points, what king appears in John Dryden’s Absalom and Achitophel, and was thought to have sought forgiveness for seducing Bathsheba in his Psalms?",David ,Literature,10
"In a chapter of Trout Fishing in America titled for this body of water, the narrator recalls discussing plans for a flea circus with his wino  friends. A book set on this body of water inspired the title of a novel by William Melvyn Kelly in which Tucker Caliban leads an exodus of Black farmers. A narrator who lost a “hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove” before coming to this body of water compares the whistle of nearby trains to the “scream of a hawk.” Selin and Ivan swim in this  American body in Elif Batuman’s The Idiot. An illiterate Canadian woodchopper who is “as bottomless as” this body visits it in a book that notes, “if a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.” The narrator of a book titled for this body of water watches a battle between red and black ants. For 10 points, name this body of water in Concord that titles a memoir by Henry David Thoreau.",Walden Pond ,Literature,10
"In this series, a shipping clerk buys easily rippable tights for a women’s wrestling league that he tries to start to “save” Ilona from a knife-throwing act. In this series, a Bible study session formatted as a play script ends with men singing “Lord God of Sabaoth,” part of a Salvation Army motif that includes verse chapters about the girl Marie. The last part of this series contains many chapters reflecting on the role of “private theologies” in a 500-year-long process called the “disintegration of values.” Milan  Kundera’s essays often praised this “polyphonic” series, in which Eduard von Bertrand’s homosexuality is exposed by Esch, who is later bayoneted by the deserter Huguenau. Lieutenant Joachim von Pasenow is the title “Romantic” of the first part of this series, which proceeds to parts on the “Anarchist” and the “Realist.” For 10 points, name this modernist trilogy by Hermann Broch.",The Sleepwalkers ,Literature,10
"In a short story set in this city, Philemon humiliates his adulterous wife Matilda by forcing her to treat the suit that her lover left behind like a real person. A baboon terrorizes this city in the story “Something Out There.” Langston Hughes was a pen pal of many writers for this city’s Drum magazine, such as an actor nicknamed “Bloke,” a journalist who composed a jazz opera about the boxer King Kong, and the novelist of Mating Birds. In a story set in this city, a golfer watches an old man collapse while carrying what he thought was his son’s  coffin. An author from a suburb of this city outlined “How  Censorship Works” in an essay whose title asks, “What Happened to” one of her novels. That author, who was part of this city’s Sophiatown Renaissance, wrote the short story “Six Feet of the Country.” For 10 points, name this city home to the author of Burger’s Daughter, Nadine Gordimer.","Johannesburg  ",Literature,10
"An essay contrasts the “immunity” felt by Trollope and Austen with this event’s intrusion into the writer’s daily lives, and wonders if this event will end the classism of the title “Leaning Tower.” Concerns about this event inspired a three-years-late reply to a letter “perhaps unique in the history of human correspondence” because it’s from an educated man asking a woman’s opinion. An essay about this event asks how we can free young Englishmen “from the machine” and ends by quoting Thomas Browne’s “half-forgotten” remark that “the  huntsmen are up in America.” The leadup to this event inspired Three Guineas. This event led to the relocation of Hogarth Press when the Woolfs’ home in Mecklenburgh Square was destroyed. For 10 points, Virginia Woolf’s suicide is often attributed to despair brought by what event that inspired “Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid?”",World War II ,Literature,10
"In a poem in this form, Master Improbable, Lord No-Such, and Sir Vacuous debate the merits of their realms’ hunting parks. A critical work on this form, which is itself titled for and written in this form, has been translated as Essay on Literature and The Art of Writing, and inspired Gary Snyder with its notion that “the model is indeed near at hand” when using an ax to carve an ax-handle. Sīmǎ Xiāngrú was a master of this “epideictic”  form, which typically presented descriptions of places or objects and were recited rather than  sung. This form is variously translated as “poetic exposition,” “prose-poem,” and “rhapsody.” This dominant poetic form of the Han Dynasty is a homonym in English with the given name of the poet of “Spring View,” who suggested it was better to have daughters than sons who will be “buried amid the grass.” For 10 points, identify this given name of the poet of “Ballad of The Army Carts.”","fù  ",Literature,10
