This quantity is the angle between the ecliptic plane and the celestial equator. For 10 points, what quantity measures the angle between a planet’s orbital and rotational axes, which gives rise to seasons?",axial tilt ,Science,5
"Rates of this process are the edge weights in a stepping-stone model. The rate of this process increases with area in the target effect and co-varies with extinction in island biogeography. This process rescues the dying patches in a metapopulation. Zooplankton do this process “diel,” or every day, in a vertical direction. In matrix models, the net rate of this process plus  birth rate minus death rate equals the change in population size. Open populations can undergo this process from sources to sinks. Barriers against this mechanism of gene flow cause allopatric speciation. Wildebeest in the Serengeti do this process in a circle, following the rain. For 10 points, name this often seasonal change in an animal’s habitat.","migration ",Science,5
"The efficacy of drugs with this property is enhanced by the crossfire effect. A common drug that has this property is purified by “milking” a moly cow and is denoted with the suffix “99-m.” Drugs with this property are used for theranostics like SPECT. Dosing of drugs with this property is calculated by comparing the “effective” and “absorbed” joules per kilogram, measured in either  grays or sieverts. Chemicals like fluorodeoxyglucose that have this property are used as tracers because they are detected with a scintillator during a PET scan. “Hot” molecules with this property like iodine-131 kill tumors by inducing mutation. For 10 points, name this property of unstable molecules that undergo nuclear decay.",radioactive ,Science,5
