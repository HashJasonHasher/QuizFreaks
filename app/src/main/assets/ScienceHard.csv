"In 2015, Strominger et al. showed that a result named for these particles was a Ward identity of certain BMS supertranslations. They’re not photons, but the change in the S matrix when a zero momentum one of these particles is added to a vertex is given by that result, which is Weinberg’s theorem on the “soft” examples of these particles. Two-loop Feynman diagrams of interactions between these particles lead to ultraviolet  divergence, but one-loop diagrams are finite due to a Gauss–Bonnet counterterm. The self-interaction of these particles reproduces an action proportional to “square root of negative det g.” These particles are coupled to the stress–energy tensor and hence are only radiated by quadrupole sources.

It’s not histidine, but a synthetic eight-amino-acid peptide targeting a variant of this protein is used in a version of  affinity chromatography in which it is tagged to recombinant proteins. Tryptophan residues line this protein’s binding pocket, which contains two shells of hydrogen bonding sites with its main ligand. This compound is frequently conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for use in western blots and ELISAs . For 10 points, name this protein used throughout molecular biology for its extremely high affinity for biotin.",avidin ,Science,10
"To solve indeterminate equations, Gauss introduced special bracket notation for approximating these expressions. When the private key in RSA is small, it can be exposed using these expressions in Wiener’s attack. The limit of these expressions’ geometric means almost always converges to Khinchin’s constant. A bijection between quadratic surds and the periodic class of these expressions is given by Minkowski’s question-mark function. Loch’s theorem produces asymptotics for these expressions’ convergents, which are subject to Legendre’s theorem in  Diophantine approximation. It’s not a decimal expansion, but while there are two of these expressions for every rational number, every irrational number can be written uniquely as an infinite one of these expressions. For 10 points, name these sequences that express a real number in terms of an infinite iteration of sums and reciprocals.",continued fractions ,Science,10
"To correct data gathered from this process, the ASTM recommends using the Dickinson extrapolation method over the Regnault–Pfaundler method. This process is used to remove organic material in a “wet” method that uses perchloric and nitric acids, or a “dry” method performed in a “muffle” instrument. This process is done within a controlled jacket in model 6200 and 6400 isoperibol instruments. To calibrate this process, the Parr Instrument Company sells one-gram pellets of  benzoic acid. This process leads to rapid changes in sample mass in evolved gas analysis methods such as TGA. The composition of a sample is determined by undergoing this process, followed by gas chromatography, in CHNS/O analysis. This process is done to completion in a crucible in ashing. For 10 points, name this exothermic process whose internal energy change is measured in bomb calorimetry.",combustion ,Science,10
"One instance of this operation is set equal to “negative one times the interaction Hamiltonian” to transform a system into a dressed ground state in the Schrieffer–Wolff transformation. Hadamard’s lemma, which expresses “e-to-the-B times A times e-to-the-negative-B” in terms of a series of this operation, is a special case of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula. The time evolution of operators in the  Heisenberg picture is given by an instance of this operation containing the Hamiltonian. The expectation of “one over 2 i times an instance of this operation” all squared appears in the generalized uncertainty principle. Two variables are canonically conjugate if applying this operation to them yields “i times h-bar.” For 10 points, name this operation that takes “A and B” and returns “A times B minus B times A.”",commutation ,Science,10
"The apical side of this tissue contains Kolmer cells, a class of unique tissue-resident macrophages. “Strap junctions” join adjacent cells early in this tissue’s development, which follows the 4-stage Netsky model and is heavily dependent on glycogen accumulation. It isn’t in the thyroid or the liver, but epithelial cells in this tissue produce the thyroxine transport protein, transthyretin. A class of secretory cells in this tissue pass their output through the  foramen of Monro. Aquaporins lining epithelial cells in this tissue provide convective  input into the glymphatic system. This tissue is lined with a class of ciliated, simple columnar cells that secrete roughly 500 milliliters of fluid daily into the lateral ventricles, which are called ependymal cells. For 10 points, name this specialized network of capillaries and secretory cells that make new cerebrospinal fluid.",choroid plexus ,Science,10
"Bouchaud et al. proposed a hyperbolic differential equation to describe the stress distribution in one of these materials, whose characteristic curves can be interpreted as “force chains.” An early model of these materials that displays a pressure less than “rho g h” at the base of a cylinder is named after Janssen. Manna names a model of these materials whose sites “topple” when they hold two particles, an example of the  “Abelian” models of these materials that display self-organized criticality. These materials’ velocity becomes non-zero in a density-dependent jamming transition. Reynolds described these materials’ change in volume under a shear stress, known as dilitancy. These materials may have a bistable angle of repose due to stabilization by internal Coulomb friction. For 10 points, in the Brazil nut effect, convection affects what materials composed of many large particles?",granular materials ,Science,10
"This reaction occurs twice between a cuprate and an 8-membered enone ring in a total synthesis that starts with serine, whose namesake also modified this reaction. This reaction is the most common mechanism by which acrolein reacts with thiol groups on amino acids. An asymmetric example of this reaction attacks with 4-hydroxycoumarin to synthesize the anticoagulant Warfarin. Both the carbanion “donor” and the alkene  “acceptor” of this reaction are stabilized by resonance and contain one or more electron-withdrawing groups. It’s not the aldol reaction, but a titanium tetrachloride catalyst is used with a silyl enol ether in this reaction’s Mukaiyama variant. This reaction has a similar mechanism to the Stork enamine reaction. This reaction begins the Robinson annulation. For 10 points, an enolate is joined to an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl by what 1,4-addition reaction?","Michael addition  ",Science,10
"This process lowers the accuracy of the so-called Bootstrap algorithm that leverages dynamic tie points to cluster data plotted using 19V, 37H, and 37V channels. This process leads to “downwasting” that is often imaged using cyanotypes. A substance partially named for this process forms the upper interface of “false bottoms.” This process directly leads to the formation of cryoconite holes due to accumulation of particulates like  soot. Resistance to this process differentiates the multiyear form of a certain substance from its first-year form. This process, which lowers albedo as it occurs, is the primary ablation process in “land-terminating” features. This process leads to the formation of namesake ponds during an annual cycle that alternates with the freeze cycle. For 10 points, name this physical process that leads to a rise in sea levels when it happens to glaciers.","melting ",Science,10
"One of these proteins binds the scaffold protein MNAR and is co-activated by each of the three p160 proteins, such as SRC-1. Mutations in one of these proteins between residues 536 and 538 in helix 12 disrupt its binding domain and are particularly oncogenic. The presence of one of these proteins differentiates the cell line MCF7 from MCF10A. A G525R mutant of one of these proteins, which is sensitive to the metabolite 4-OHT, is commonly used to study  embryonic-lethal genes since their expression can be controlled by administration of tamoxifen, which targets these proteins. The nuclear and membrane variants of these proteins each bind all four isoforms of their primary ligand, which are distinguished by their one to four hydroxyl groups. For 10 points, name these proteins that with HER2 and the progesterone receptor are commonly used to delineate breast cancer severity.","estrogen receptors ",Science,10
"This is the heaviest element for which a solid trimethyl source is used to react it with group V  materials in the MOVPE process. A lab at Oregon discovered a pigment in which this element and yttrium help expose the intense blue color of plus-3 manganese ions. The most common sources for this high-demand p-block element are leaching from zinc sulfide ores and recovery after its most notable compound is etched onto glass and wafers. This is the  second of four elements in the name of a flexible semiconductor that competes with  amorphous silicon and cadmium telluride for use in thin-film solar cells. Aluminum-doped zinc oxide is a cheaper alternative to a compound containing this metal and tin that is deposited to create transparent conducting films. This metal is named for the blue-violet line in its spectrum. For 10 points, name this metal found in LCDs as its tin oxide.","indium  ",Science,10
"A mixture of chloral hydrate, phenol, and mercuric chloride colors this substance blue-green or magenta in Alexander’s stain. Either the nuclear stain TTC or the dye fluorescein  diacetate are used in viability assays for this substance. In vitro culture of this substance uses a “hanging drop” technique in which individual drops of boron-rich media are loaded with it and placed into a cavity slide. Auramine and calcofluor stain this substance’s  exine and intine layers, respectively, which begin to form after four callose walls are degraded. The enzyme callase and the protein RAFTIN are supplied by Ubisch bodies from the tapetum to strengthen this substance. The relative location of the stomium determines if this substance undergoes “extrorse” or “introrse” dehiscence  from the anther.
