To prevent damage to it and increase its stability, this structure is coated by a buffer and a jacket. Two layers of this type of structure allow for propagation of multiple  wavelengths in the “double”-this structure geometry. This component is generated by drilling patterned holes in silica in a photonic crystal-based design for the larger device it is part of. This structure has a lower refractive index than the innermost layer, allowing for signals to be propagated via total internal reflection. For 10 points, name this layer of an optical fiber that surrounds the core.",cladding ,Science,9
"Description acceptable. In the “cloud-in-cloud” problem, these regions correspond to the outer clouds. In an Einstein-de Sitter universe, a ratio named for these objects is exactly equal to 18 times pi squared at virialization. These regions are perturbations with a “top-hat” shaped profile in the spherical collapse model, which models their growth. The aforementioned ratio named for these objects is symbolized delta and is often rounded to 200 in calculations of virial radius. These regions in the primordial plasma generate  baryon acoustic oscillations in the CMB spectrum. These regions are produced by the amplifications of quantum fluctuations by inflation, and therefore serve as the “seeds” of structure formation. For 10 points, name these regions where a quantity equal to mass over volume is greater than that of the universe as a whole.","overdensities ",Science,9
"Robert Randall coined the term pseudo-cyclostationary to describe the effect of local defects on the acceleration signals of these systems. Defects in these systems may cause the appearance of four vibration frequencies in their spectra abbreviated BPFO, BPFI, BSF and FTF. Non-noise failure of these systems may be caused by heavy loads causing indentations called brinell marks in their  raceways. The adjective ""main"" describes typically paired, hydrodynamically lubricated examples of these structures that hold the crankshaft of a piston in place. These mechanical systems function both by supporting a load and by constraining the relative motion between two elements of a machine. For 10 points, name these friction-reducing elements whose ""ball"" variety consist of metal spheres that roll between a pair of metal rings.","bearings  ",Science,9
"Howe and Smallwood explained anisotropic distributions of this quantity through a ""directed"" form of a certain process. Either probability or this quantity is the typical y-axis of a fat-tailed kernel whose fat-tail is explained by LDD events. Negative dependence on this quantity is predicted by the Janzen-Connell model, in which specialists are responsive to either distance or this quantity. In type 2 and 3 functional responses, as this quantity approaches infinity, the intake rate approaches an asymptote. In r/K selection theory, increased  r is favored when this quantity is low, while increased K is favored when this quantity is high. Limiting factors for which growth rate is said to be dependent on this quantity include intraspecific competition and infectious diseases. For 10 points, name this quantity equal to population size over area.",population density ,Science,9
"Labile examples of these substances are isolated with the assistance of a vacuum pump in a technique called SAFE. The FD factor describes the last dilution at which one of these substances is detectable, and is determined through the procedure AEDA . These substances are analyzed in a two stage procedure whose first stage is gas chromatography and whose second stage is a panel of human assessors. Fixatives called resinoids are added to mixtures of these substances to equalize their  volatilities, thus increasing the tenacity of the mixture. These substances are often isolated by performing steam distillation on a sample of crushed plant matter. More volatile examples of these substances are used as top notes, while less volatile ones are used as middle or base notes. For 10 points, name these substances detectable by the human olfactory system.","fragrances ",Science,9
"A type of object denoted by this adjective is lower bounded in size by the exponential of “n to the one over depth minus one,” by Håstad’s “switching lemma.” Those directed acyclic graphs described by this adjective are used to define the complexity classes AC and P/poly . A result about a problem described by this adjective would cause the polynomial hierarchy to collapse to its second level, by the Karp-Lipton theorem. Expressions denoted by this adjective can be written in  disjunctive or conjunctive normal form. k is often set to three in a problem whose name begins with this adjective, which is the subject of the Cook-Levin theorem. That problem asks whether a formula denoted by this adjective is satisfiable. For 10 points, give this proper adjective that names a type of algebra that uses AND and OR operators to manipulate truth values.",Boolean ,Science,9
"In early experiments of one technique, elastic stretching of these things resulted in a pressure gradient, necessitating the creation of pressure-transmitting media. In variations of one technique, higher resolution imaging may be achieved by fitting one of these things with a microSQUID. The movement of electrons between a sample and one of these things is modeled by a rectangular potential of height on the order of the work function of the surface of these things. One of these things is fixed to the free end of a  cantilever in an atomic force microscope. In one technique, a piezoelectric tube attached to an extremely sharp, conducting example of these things applies a bias voltage, allowing for electrons to tunnel through the vacuum separating the sample and this thing. For 10 points, in scanning tunneling microscopy, what part of the apparatus is suspended directly above a sample?",tips ,Science,9
"They’re not dimers, but scattering between two of these things involves computing the cylinder amplitude. Ashoke Sen conjectured that the sum of the tension of two of these objects exactly cancels the contribution of the tachyon potential at a local minimum. Two of these things named for Planck and the TeV  scale differ in the strength of gravity in the Randall-Sundrum model. A namesake field of cosmology posits that the visible universe is confined to one of these objects within a higher-dimensional  “bulk.” As these objects move through spacetime, they sweep out an n+1 dimensional worldvolume. A form of these things that satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions are prefixed with the letter D. A lowercase p signifies the dimension of these things, which correspond to point particles for p=0. For 10 points, name these higher-dimensional generalizations of strings.",branes ,Science,9
